                <h2>OUR JOURNEY TO INSPIRE</h2>
                <p>
                  The Falconer began as a slow &lsquo;what if&rsquo; over a
                  phone call between our editor and sub-editor. Covid had
                  stirred a sense of uncertainty, and there was everywhere a
                  quietness about life. The magazine started out, then, as a
                  means of sending out some ripples of sound, a voice comforted
                  with the hope of a patient ear on the other side.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Our founding members — Moaz, Zonera, Manal, and Amtul —
                  experimented for over five months before they landed on the
                  final form of the magazine that we now see as The Falconer.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  To them, it has been all of it — the chaos, care, and comfort
                  of a household wrapped around its firstborn.
